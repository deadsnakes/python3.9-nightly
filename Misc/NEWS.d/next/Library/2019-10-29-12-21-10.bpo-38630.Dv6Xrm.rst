On Unix, :meth:`subprocess.Popen.send_signal` now polls the process status.
Polling reduces the risk of sending a signal to the wrong process if the
process completed, the :attr:`subprocess.Popen.returncode` attribute is still
``None``, and the pid has been reassigned (recycled) to a new different
process.
