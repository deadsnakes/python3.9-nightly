Simplified AST for subscription. Simple indices are now represented by their
value, extended slices are represented as tuples.  :mod:`ast` classes
``Index`` and ``ExtSlice`` are considered deprecated and will be removed in
future Python versions. In the meantime, ``Index(value)`` now returns
a ``value`` itself, ``ExtSlice(slices)`` returns ``Tuple(slices, Load())``.
