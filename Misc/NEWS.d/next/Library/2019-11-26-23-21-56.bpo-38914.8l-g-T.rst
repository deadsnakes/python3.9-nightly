Adjusted the wording of the warning issued by distutils' ``check`` command when
the ``author`` and ``maintainer`` fields are supplied but no corresponding
e-mail field (``author_email`` or ``maintainer_email``) is found. The wording
now reflects the fact that these fields are suggested, but not required. Patch
by Juergen Gmach.
