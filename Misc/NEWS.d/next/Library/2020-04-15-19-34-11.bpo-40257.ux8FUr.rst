func:`inspect.getdoc` no longer returns docstring inherited from the type of
the object or from parent class if it is a class if it is not defined in the
object itself. In :mod:`pydoc` the documentation string is now shown not
only for class, function, method etc, but for any object that has its own
``__doc__`` attribute.
