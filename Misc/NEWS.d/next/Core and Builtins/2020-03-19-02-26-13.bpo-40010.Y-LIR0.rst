Optimize signal handling in multithreaded applications. If a thread different
than the main thread gets a signal, the bytecode evaluation loop is no longer
interrupted at each bytecode instruction to check for pending signals which
cannot be handled. Only the main thread of the main interpreter can handle
signals.

Previously, the bytecode evaluation loop was interrupted at each instruction
until the main thread handles signals.
