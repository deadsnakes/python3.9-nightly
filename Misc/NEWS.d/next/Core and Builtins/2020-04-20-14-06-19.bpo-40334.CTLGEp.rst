Switch to a new parser, based on PEG.  For more details see PEP 617. To
temporarily switch back to the old parser, use ``-X oldparser`` or
``PYTHONOLDPARSER=1``.  In Python 3.10 we will remove the old parser
completely, including the ``parser`` module (already deprecated) and
anything that depends on it.
