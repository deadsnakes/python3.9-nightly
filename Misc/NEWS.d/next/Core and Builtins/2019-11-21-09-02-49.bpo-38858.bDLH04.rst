Each Python subinterpreter now has its own "small integer singletons":
numbers in [-5; 257] range. It is no longer possible to change the number of
small integers at build time by overriding ``NSMALLNEGINTS`` and
``NSMALLPOSINTS`` macros: macros should now be modified manually in
``pycore_pystate.h`` header file.
