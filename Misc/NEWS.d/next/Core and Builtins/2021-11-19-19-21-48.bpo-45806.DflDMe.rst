Re-introduced fix that allows recovery from stack overflow without crashing
the interpreter.  The original fix as part of :issue:`42500` was reverted
(see release notes for Python 3.9.4) since it introduced an ABI change in a
bugfix release which is not allowed.  The new fix doesn't introduce any ABI
changes.  Patch by Mark Shannon.
