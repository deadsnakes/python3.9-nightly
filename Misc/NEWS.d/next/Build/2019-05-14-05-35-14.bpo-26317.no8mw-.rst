The OBJC and OBJCXX standard command line options for the configure script are now supported. This allows building fot macOS with a third-party compiler, like GNU gcc, for everything except for the several system-specific source files that need system headers that require the Apple-supplied compile chain (e.g. the _scproxy helper module and PythonLauncher.app).  Patch by Jeffrey Kintscher.
